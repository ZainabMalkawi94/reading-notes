## Redux - Additional Topics
#### Redux Toolkit (RTK)
1. What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?

    Redux Toolkit addresses concerns related to managing state in Redux applications by providing utilities for:
    1. Simplifying the Redux boilerplate code, reducing development time.
    2. Encouraging a normalized state shape for better data organization.
    3. Offering built-in support for asynchronous actions and immutability, enhancing maintainability and performance.
2. What does configureStore() do?

    `configureStore()` is a function from Redux Toolkit that simplifies the setup of a Redux store. It:
    1. Combines multiple reducers into one and configures Redux DevTools extension.
    2. Provides sensible defaults for middleware, such as Redux Thunk for handling async actions.
    3. Streamlines store creation, making it easier to set up a Redux store with best practices.
3. How would I use createSlice()?

    To use `createSlice()` from Redux Toolkit:

    1. Define an initial state and a set of reducer functions within the `createSlice` call.
    2. This function will automatically generate a reducer, action creators, and action types based on the provided configuration.
    3. Export the generated reducer and action creators to use in your Redux application for managing state and dispatching actions.

### MobX
1. What is Mobx?

    Mobx is a JavaScript library for state management in web applications. It enables reactive programming by automatically tracking and updating data dependencies, making it easier to maintain and synchronize UI components with application state. Mobx is often used as an alternative to Redux for more intuitive and concise state management in React applications.
2. How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?

    Mobx achieves consistency by automatically tracking and updating state changes. It enforces a strict rule that only allows modifications within actions, ensuring that all changes occur in a controlled manner. This prevents race conditions and guarantees that the state is always in a consistent and predictable state.
3. How would we build a reactive user interface?

    To build a reactive user interface:

    1. Use a reactive state management library like Mobx or Vue.js with computed properties to automatically update UI elements when underlying data changes.
    2. Structure your UI components to depend on observable state, ensuring they reactively re-render when the data they rely on changes.
    3. Utilize two-way data binding or event-driven mechanisms to keep the UI in sync with user interactions and changes to the reactive state.
