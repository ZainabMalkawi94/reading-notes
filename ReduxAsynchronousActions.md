## Redux - Asynchronous Actions
#### async actions

1. Why use Redux middleware?

    Redux middleware is used to handle asynchronous actions in Redux. It intercepts actions before they reach the reducer, enabling side effects like API calls and dispatching multiple actions.

2. Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.

    In the Redux Async Data Flow, an action creator dispatches an async action, middleware (like Redux Thunk) processes it, performs async tasks, and eventually dispatches a regular action with the result.
3. How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?

    We accommodate async in Redux by using middleware like Redux Thunk, which lets us write async logic within action creators, making it possible to handle async operations in a Redux app.

#### Thunk middleware

1. Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?

    You need redux-thunk middleware to handle asynchronous operations, like API requests, within Redux action creators. It allows action creators to return functions instead of plain actions, enabling you to dispatch actions at a later time or based on certain conditions, making it easier to manage complex asynchronous logic in your Redux application.

2. Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.

    Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a **function** instead of an action.

3. Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.

    The return value from the inner thunk function can be made available through a promise or callback mechanism, depending on how you structure your asynchronous logic. You can use the `dispatch` function within the thunk to dispatch actions with the result, which will trigger changes in the Redux store and potentially update your UI based on the outcome of the async operation. It's essential to handle the returned values appropriately to manage application state effectively.
