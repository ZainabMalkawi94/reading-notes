### AWS Lambda Basics

1. What is AWS Lambda?

    AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows developers to run code without managing servers, automatically scaling based on the incoming request volume. Lambda supports various programming languages and integrates with other AWS services for event-driven application development.
2. Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.

    1. Real-time Data Processing: Lambdas are commonly used for real-time data processing tasks such as stream processing, data transformations, and filtering. They can integrate with services like Amazon Kinesis, Apache Kafka, or Amazon DynamoDB Streams to process and analyze data as it arrives.

    2. Microservices Architecture: Lambdas are ideal for building microservices-based architectures, where each function handles a specific task or business logic. They can be invoked independently and scale automatically based on demand, enabling efficient and modular application development.

    3. Serverless Web Applications: Lambdas can be used to handle backend logic for serverless web applications. They can process API requests, perform authentication and authorization, interact with databases, and respond with dynamic content, reducing the need for managing traditional servers.

    4. Data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Lambdas are often employed for data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks. They can pull data from various sources, apply transformations, and load it into target systems such as data warehouses, databases, or analytics platforms.

    5. Scheduled Tasks and Cron Jobs: Lambdas can be scheduled to run at specific times or intervals, making them suitable for handling scheduled tasks or cron jobs. This includes activities like periodic data backups, report generation, data cleanup, or any other repetitive task.

    6. IoT Data Processing: Lambdas are used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications to process and analyze data generated by IoT devices. They can handle data ingestion, perform real-time analytics, trigger alerts or notifications, and interact with other AWS services for IoT management.

    7. Image or File Processing: Lambdas can be utilized for image or file processing tasks such as resizing images, generating thumbnails, extracting metadata, or validating file formats. They can integrate with services like Amazon S3 or Amazon Rekognition to perform intelligent image analysis.

    These are just a few examples of the wide range of use cases for AWS Lambda, showcasing its versatility and ability to handle various types of workloads in a serverless manner.

3. Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.

    "Serverless" means that you don't have to worry about managing or provisioning servers. You can focus solely on writing and deploying your code, and the cloud provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure to run it.

### CDN

1. What is a CDN?


    A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a distributed network of servers located in different geographical locations. Its purpose is to deliver web content, such as images, videos, scripts, and other static files, to end-users quickly and efficiently.

2. How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

    When a website visitor requests content from a website that uses a CDN, the CDN determines the visitor's location and serves the content from the closest server in its network. This reduces the distance the data has to travel, minimizing latency and improving the website's performance. The CDN caches content, stores it temporarily on its servers, and delivers it to subsequent visitors from the cache, further enhancing speed and reducing the load on the website's origin server.

3. What are the benefits of employing a CDN?

    The benefits of employing a CDN include:

    1. Improved Website Performance: By serving content from servers closer to the visitor's location, a CDN reduces latency, enabling faster page load times and a better user experience.

    2. Global Content Delivery: CDNs have servers distributed worldwide, allowing content to be delivered from nearby locations regardless of the visitor's geographic location. This ensures consistent performance and faster content delivery for users worldwide.

    3. Scalability and Reliability: CDNs are designed to handle high traffic volumes and sudden spikes in demand. They distribute the load across multiple servers, reducing the strain on the origin server and improving the website's resilience to handle traffic surges.

    4. Bandwidth Savings: CDNs help reduce bandwidth consumption on the origin server. By caching and serving content from their servers, CDNs offload a significant portion of the traffic, reducing hosting costs and improving the scalability of the website.

    5. DDoS Mitigation: CDNs can provide protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Their distributed infrastructure can absorb and mitigate large-scale attacks, ensuring the website remains available during such incidents.

    6. Analytics and Insights: Many CDNs offer analytics and reporting features, providing insights into website performance, traffic patterns, and user behavior. These insights help optimize content delivery, improve user experience, and make data-driven decisions for website optimization.
