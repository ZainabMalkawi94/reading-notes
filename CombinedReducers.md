## Redux - Combined Reducers
### Multiple Reducers Example
1. Why create multiple reducers?

    Creating multiple reducers is a best practice in state management to improve code organization, maintainability, scalability, and collaboration in your application development process. It helps you build more modular, reusable, and manageable codebases, especially in large and complex projects.

2. How would you combine multiple reducers?

    To combine multiple reducers in Redux, you can use the `combineReducers` function from the Redux library. Simply import it and pass an object where each key represents a slice of state managed by a reducer, then use the combined reducer in your store configuration. For example:

    ```javascript
    import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

    const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    reducer1,
    reducer2,
    // Add more reducers as needed
    });

    // Use `rootReducer` when creating your Redux store
    const store = createStore(rootReducer);
    ```

    This combines the individual reducers into a single reducer that can be used to manage your application's entire state.

3. How will you manage state as an immutable object? why?

    Managing state as an immutable object in Redux is crucial for predictable state changes and efficient change detection. By treating state as immutable, you ensure that each state update creates a new object, making it easier to track changes, compare previous and current states, and implement time-travel debugging. Immutable state simplifies debugging, reduces unexpected side effects, and enhances the predictability of your application's behavior.

### Redux Docs: Using Combined Reducers
  1. combineReducers is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing ___ _____ .

        `combineReducers` is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing Redux reducers.
  2. Explain how combineReducers assembles the new state tree.

        `combineReducers` in Redux assembles the new state tree by delegating the responsibility for managing different slices of the state to individual reducers and combining their results into a single state object. Here's how it works:

        1. **Configuration**: When you use `combineReducers`, you pass in an object where each key corresponds to a slice of the state and the value is the corresponding reducer function for that slice.

        2. **Dispatching an Action**: When an action is dispatched, it goes through all the reducers defined in the configuration.

        3. **Reducer Invocation**: Each reducer is invoked with its respective slice of the current state (previous state) and the action being dispatched.

        4. **State Update**: Each reducer processes the action and returns the next state for its slice. Importantly, reducers must be pure functions and produce new state objects instead of modifying the previous state in place.

        5. **Combining Slices**: `combineReducers` combines the next state objects from all the reducers into a single state tree. It uses the same keys that were defined in the initial configuration to create the new state object, where each key corresponds to the respective slice of the state.

        6. **New State Tree**: The result is a new state tree, where each slice is updated based on the corresponding reducer's logic.

        This process ensures that Redux state remains immutable, as each reducer produces a new state object instead of modifying the existing one. The combination of these individual state slices forms the complete state tree, and this new state tree is then used for rendering components and updating the application's UI.

  3. How would you define initial state in an app using combineReducers?

        In an app that uses `combineReducers` in Redux, you define the initial state by creating an object where each key corresponds to a slice of the state managed by a specific reducer. Here's how you would typically define initial state:

        ```javascript
        import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
        import reducer1 from './reducer1';
        import reducer2 from './reducer2';

        // Define the initial state for each reducer
        const initialState = {
        slice1: reducer1InitialState,
        slice2: reducer2InitialState,
        // Add more slices and initial states as needed
        };

        // Combine reducers and set initial state
        const rootReducer = combineReducers({
        slice1: reducer1,
        slice2: reducer2,
        // Add more reducers as needed
        });

        export default rootReducer;
        ```

        In the code above:

        1. You import `combineReducers` from Redux and your individual reducers (e.g., `reducer1` and `reducer2`).

        2. You create an `initialState` object where each key (`slice1`, `slice2`, etc.) corresponds to a slice of the state managed by a specific reducer. You set the initial state for each slice according to your application's requirements.

        3. When you combine the reducers using `combineReducers`, you associate each reducer with its corresponding slice key. Redux will use the initial state you defined for each slice when the application starts.

        4. Finally, you export the `rootReducer`, which is the combined reducer with the specified initial state for each slice. This `rootReducer` is then used to create the Redux store.

### Redux Docs: Combined Reducer Syntax
  1. Why will you want to split your reducing functions as your app becomes more complex?

        1. **Modularity**: Splitting reducing functions (reducers) as the app grows enhances modularity. Each reducer focuses on a specific part of the state, making code organization and maintenance more manageable.

        2. **Scalability**: As the app's complexity increases, having separate reducers allows multiple developers to work on different parts simultaneously, promoting scalability and parallel development.

        3. **Testing and Debugging**: Smaller, focused reducers are easier to test and debug, ensuring that each state slice behaves as expected and making it simpler to isolate and fix issues.

  2. The _____ helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to ____.

        The `combineReducers` helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to the Redux store configuration.


  3. What is a popular convention when naming reducers?

        A popular convention when naming reducers in Redux is to use descriptive and self-explanatory names that indicate the specific slice of state they manage. The common convention is to use camelCase for reducer names. Here are some examples:

        1. `userReducer` for managing user-related state.
        2. `cartReducer` for managing shopping cart state.
        3. `todosReducer` for managing a list of to-do items.
        4. `authReducer` for handling authentication-related state.
        5. `appSettingsReducer` for managing application settings.

        These names make it clear what each reducer is responsible for and contribute to the maintainability and readability of your Redux code.
