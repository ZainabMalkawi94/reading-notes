## Event Driven Applications
1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

    The native Node.js module that enables Event Driven Programming is called `events`. It provides an `EventEmitter` class that serves as the foundation for event-driven architecture. You can create your own custom event emitters by extending the `EventEmitter` class, emit events using the `emit()` method, and register event listeners with the `on()` or `addListener()` methods. This module is essential for building applications that leverage asynchronous and event-based paradigms in Node.js.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

    Object Oriented Programming (OOP) used in tandem with Event Driven Programming brings several benefits:

    1. Encapsulation: OOP allows you to encapsulate related data and behavior into objects. When combined with Event Driven Programming, it provides a modular and organized approach to handling events and their associated logic.

    2. Reusability: OOP promotes code reuse through concepts like inheritance and polymorphism. By applying OOP principles to Event Driven Programming, you can create reusable event handling components that can be easily integrated into different parts of your application.

    3. Modularity: OOP allows you to break down complex systems into smaller, manageable modules. This modular approach aligns well with Event Driven Programming, as events can be handled by specific objects or classes, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.

    4. Abstraction: OOP enables you to abstract away implementation details and focus on the higher-level interactions between objects. Event Driven Programming complements this by providing a high-level abstraction of asynchronous and event-based interactions, simplifying the design and understanding of complex systems.

    By combining OOP with Event Driven Programming, you can achieve better code organization, reusability, and maintainability while leveraging the power of events for asynchronous and event-driven systems.




3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

    Imagine you're running a website or a web application that needs to handle a lot of tasks simultaneously, like processing user requests, saving data to a database, and communicating with other services. Event Driven Programming in the backend using Node.js can be incredibly useful in such scenarios.

    Here's an analogy to help explain it: Think of your backend as a chef in a busy restaurant kitchen. Instead of having just one chef doing one task at a time, Event Driven Programming allows you to have multiple chefs working together efficiently.

    In Node.js, events are like signals or messages that different parts of your backend can send and receive. For example, when a user sends a request to your website, an event is triggered. This event can be captured by specific pieces of code that are designed to handle that particular event, just like a specialized chef in the kitchen who knows exactly how to prepare a specific dish.

    This approach has several benefits. Firstly, it enables parallel processing. Each chef (or event handler) can work on their own task independently, without waiting for others. This allows the backend to handle multiple requests simultaneously, making your website or application more responsive and faster.

    Secondly, Event Driven Programming makes your backend more modular and flexible. You can have different event handlers for different tasks, just like different chefs for different dishes. This modular structure makes it easier to add or modify functionality without disrupting the entire system.

    Additionally, events allow different parts of your backend to communicate and collaborate seamlessly. For example, one event handler may handle a user registration event and save the data to a database, while another event handler may listen for the "data saved" event and trigger a notification to the user. This asynchronous communication between different components is what makes Node.js and Event Driven Programming so powerful.

    In summary, Event Driven Programming in the backend using Node.js helps you handle multiple tasks efficiently, make your code modular and flexible, and enables seamless communication between different parts of your application. Just like chefs in a busy kitchen, it allows your backend to handle a high volume of requests smoothly, making your website or application more responsive and scalable.
