### AWS EC2

1. What is an EC2 Instance?


   An EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance is a virtual server provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing users to quickly scale up or down based on their computing needs. EC2 instances are commonly used for hosting applications, running databases, and performing various computational tasks.

2. Name 2 use cases for EC2.

   1. Web Hosting: EC2 instances are commonly used for hosting websites and web applications. Users can deploy their web servers on EC2 instances, configure them according to their requirements, and easily scale the instances to handle varying levels of traffic.

   2. Big Data Processing: EC2 instances provide a scalable and flexible environment for processing and analyzing large datasets. Users can leverage EC2's computational power to run big data frameworks like Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark, perform complex analytics, and process vast amounts of data efficiently.
3. Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.

   One reason to use Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) instead of services like Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com is the deep integration and compatibility with other AWS services. ECS seamlessly integrates with other AWS offerings such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon VPC, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). This enables users to build highly scalable and complex applications that leverage a wide range of AWS services, benefiting from a cohesive ecosystem and streamlined management of their infrastructure.

### EC2 For Humans

1. Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?

   1. Go to the AWS Management Console by visiting the AWS website and signing in with your AWS account credentials.
   2. Once logged in, you will be on the AWS Management Console dashboard. In the search bar at the top of the page, type "EC2" and press Enter or click on the magnifying glass icon.
   3. The search results will display various services related to EC2. Click on "EC2" to open the EC2 Dashboard.

   Alternatively, you can directly navigate to EC2 without using the search bar by selecting "Services" in the top navigation bar, scrolling down or searching for "Compute" in the services list, and then clicking on "EC2" under the Compute section.

   Once you are on the EC2 Dashboard, you will have access to various features and options for managing your EC2 instances, security groups, key pairs, volumes, and other related resources.
2. Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.

   T2 Micro and T2 XL are both instance types within the T2 family of Amazon EC2 instances. The general difference between them lies in their computing resources, specifically CPU and memory capacity.

   1. T2 Micro: T2 Micro instances are the smallest within the T2 family. They offer a single vCPU (virtual CPU) and 1 GiB of memory. T2 Micro instances are designed for low to moderate workloads and are suitable for applications that have modest performance requirements or do not require significant computational power.

   2. T2 XL: T2 XL instances, on the other hand, provide higher compute capacity compared to T2 Micro. They offer multiple vCPUs and more memory. The exact specifications of T2 XL instances depend on the specific instance size, such as T2.XLarge or T2.2XLarge. These larger T2 instances are suitable for applications or workloads that require more CPU power and memory, allowing for increased performance and the ability to handle heavier workloads.

   In summary, T2 Micro instances have lower compute resources, making them appropriate for lightweight workloads, while T2 XL instances have more substantial compute resources, suitable for applications that require higher performance and can handle more demanding workloads.


3. Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
   Imagine a compute cycle as a single step or task that a computer performs. Just like how we humans follow a series of steps to complete a task, a computer also goes through different steps to process information or perform calculations. These steps include tasks like fetching data, analyzing it, making calculations, and producing results.

   For example, when you click on a photo-editing software and apply a filter to an image, the computer goes through multiple compute cycles to make that happen. In each cycle, it fetches the image, analyzes the pixels, applies the filter algorithm, and produces the modified image. These cycles happen very quickly, often millions or billions of times per second.

   In simpler terms, a compute cycle represents a small unit of work that a computer performs to process data or perform a task. The more compute cycles a computer can handle in a given time, the faster it can process information and perform tasks efficiently.

### Elastic Beanstalk

1. What is Elastic Beanstalk?

   Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of applications by abstracting away the underlying infrastructure. With Elastic Beanstalk, developers can focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying server infrastructure, networking, or system administration tasks.

   Elastic Beanstalk supports various programming languages and frameworks, including Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and Go. It provides a platform-specific runtime environment for each supported language, which includes the necessary components and configurations to run applications written in those languages.

   When deploying an application to Elastic Beanstalk, developers can upload their application code and Elastic Beanstalk handles the provisioning and configuration of the underlying infrastructure, such as virtual machines, load balancers, databases, and networking. It automatically scales the application based on demand, monitors its health, and provides logs and metrics for troubleshooting and analysis.

   Elastic Beanstalk also integrates with other AWS services, allowing developers to easily incorporate features like Amazon RDS for databases, Amazon S3 for storage, Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) for notifications, and more into their applications.

   Overall, Elastic Beanstalk offers a streamlined way to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud, abstracting away the complexities of infrastructure management and enabling developers to focus on building their applications.

2. Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.
   Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) are both services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) but serve different purposes. Here's the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk:

   1. Elastic Beanstalk as a Managed Service: Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering by AWS. It abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, including EC2 instances, and provides an easy way to deploy and manage applications. Developers can focus on writing code while Elastic Beanstalk handles the deployment, scaling, and management aspects.
