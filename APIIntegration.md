## API Integration
### **Review API Server Build:**
The API server build refers to the process of creating and setting up a server that exposes endpoints to allow communication between different software applications. It involves defining routes, handling requests and responses, and ensuring the server operates reliably and securely.

**Query String Parameter vs. Path Parameter:**
- **Query String Parameter:** It's a parameter passed in the URL after a question mark (?), used for optional data like filters or search terms. Example: `http://example.com/api/resource?filter=keyword`.

- **Path Parameter:** It's a parameter embedded within the URL path, used to specify a resource or identifier directly. Example: `http://example.com/api/resource/123`.

**API URL with Path ID Parameter:**
Given the information provided, the API URL with a path ID parameter for the "stuff" model and "things" ID would be: `http://our-site.com/v3/stuff/things`.

**Dynamic API with an "Interface" Explanation:**
Imagine the API interface like a menu at a restaurant. It's like a user-friendly way for different computer programs to order exactly what they need from the kitchen (the server). The menu (interface) lists the dishes (endpoints), and each dish (endpoint) has options (parameters) you can customize. So, the interface helps programs communicate with the server and get the right data or perform actions easily.
