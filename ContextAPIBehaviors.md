### Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

#### How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)
`useReducer` and `useContext` are two essential hooks in React that can be used in combination to simplify and manage state effectively in your application, particularly when dealing with complex or deeply nested component trees.

- `useReducer` is a hook that allows you to manage state in a more controlled manner using a reducer function. It follows the same principles as the traditional Redux state management pattern. You define a reducer function that takes the current state and an action as inputs and returns the new state based on the action type. This approach makes state transitions more predictable and maintainable, especially when handling more complex logic or multiple state updates in a single action.

- `useContext`, on the other hand, enables you to create a context that holds global state accessible to any component within its subtree. This is particularly useful when you have data that needs to be shared among components without passing props down through multiple levels. By using `useContext`, components can directly access the state provided by the context without the need for prop drilling.

When `useReducer` and `useContext` are used together, you can centralize your state management logic and provide components with an easy way to access and modify the shared state. You can create a context that utilizes the `useReducer` function to manage the state, and then make this state accessible to any component that consumes the context. Components can dispatch actions to the reducer through the context, triggering state updates in a more organized and predictable way.
